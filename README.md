# GreenSight: Plant Disease Diagnosis with CNN

## Overview

"GreenSight" is a  machine learning project that aims to revolutionize the field of plant disease diagnosis. Utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our model focuses on the early detection of diseases in plants. This innovative approach is not just a leap in agricultural technology but also a significant contribution to sustainable farming practices.

## Project Significance

The importance of early and accurate plant disease diagnosis cannot be overstated in the context of global food security. Timely detection of diseases can lead to effective treatment, preventing crop losses and ensuring agricultural productivity. By leveraging advanced CNN models, GreenSight aims to provide farmers and agronomists with a tool that can detect plant diseases accurately and quickly.

## Dataset

The backbone of our model is the PlantVillage dataset, an extensive collection of images representing various plant leaves, both healthy and diseased. This dataset covers a wide range of plant species, making our model versatile and robust. The use of this dataset facilitates the training of our CNN model to recognize and classify different plant diseases accurately.

## Methodology and Technical Approach

Our CNN model is structured to capture the intricate patterns and features of plant leaves. The architecture includes multiple layers like convolutional layers, MaxPooling, and Dropout layers, which help in learning the complex representations of plant diseases. We have also employed advanced techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance the model's learning capacity and generalize its applicability across various plant species.

## Key Innovations

Disease-Specific Classification: Our model is not just limited to detecting diseased plants but can also classify the specific type of disease, thereby providing more actionable insights.
Optimized CNN Architecture: The model incorporates a fine-tuned CNN architecture, balancing complexity and performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Comparative Analysis: We conducted an in-depth analysis comparing traditional CNN models with those enhanced through transfer learning, providing valuable insights into the efficacy of different approaches in plant disease detection.

## Results and Impact

The project demonstrated notable achievements in plant disease detection using our CNN model. Key results include:

**High Accuracy**: Achieved high overall accuracies, notably 0.95 in Pepper and Cherry, and an impressive 0.98 in Peach.
**Disease-Specific Performance**: Excelled in identifying specific diseases like Bacterial Spot in Pepper and Powdery Mildew in Cherry with precision and recall above 0.94.
**Varied Effectiveness**: Observed varied performance across different plants, with strong results in Corn (0.93 accuracy) and challenges in Potato (0.38 accuracy).
**Room for Improvement**: Some diseases, particularly in Apple, presented complexities, indicating the need for further model optimization.
The impact of these findings is significant in agricultural technology. While the model shows great promise in several areas, the variations in accuracy highlight the ongoing challenges in AI-driven plant disease diagnosis, underscoring the importance of continued research and development in this field.
